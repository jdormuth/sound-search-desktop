# sound-search-desktop
This is a simple app that allows the user to upload
a wav or caf loop/sample and a library. It will then
search the user's library to find loops that are similar
and return the top ten results. 

A use case of this app would be to search for bass and drum
lines that are similar and "fit" togther. To give some examples,
I've fed the app a couple different logic drum loops from the hip hop,
R&B, and electro house libraries. Then I fed in the bass instrument 
libraries for each genre to help determine which bass lines fit best with 
each drum loop. The results can be seen here, https://soundcloud.com/jacob-dormuth/sets/ai-beat-pairings.
